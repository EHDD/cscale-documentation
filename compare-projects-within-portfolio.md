### Total Emissions Over 60 Years

This figure describes the cumulative carbon emissions of a building over time. As a chart of cumulative emissions, the height of the bar is the total emissions associated with the building up to and including that year rather than only the emissions associated with that year.

This chart has a number of elements:

* **Choice of overall units**. Choose to view the emissions in kgCO₂e/m² or tCO₂e.
* **Refrigerant Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with the refrigerant use in the building services.&#x20;
* **Electricity Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with the energy use from the electrical grid.&#x20;
* **Fossil Fuel Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with onsite fossil fuel use.&#x20;
* **Embodied carbon emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with building materials, their replacements, and with landscape maintenance.
* **Biogenic Carbon Storage**. Sequestered emissions from building structure and landscape planting.
* **Avoided Energy Emissions**. Avoided emissions from onsite energy generation in excess of use.

Hovering over a bar gives the summary of emissions of that project. Note that these numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred and may not sum to net emissions in all cases.
