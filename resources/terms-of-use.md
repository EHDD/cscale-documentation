Customer represents and warrants that: (i) all required Account registration information submitted is truthful and accurate; and (ii) Customer will maintain the accuracy of such information.  Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all Account login information and is fully responsible for all activities that occur under Customer‚Äôs and its Authorized Users‚Äô Accounts.  Customer will use reasonable efforts to prevent any unauthorized access or use of the Services and Customer agrees to immediately notify C.Scale of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of the Accounts or any other breach of security.  Additionally, if there is unauthorized access or use by anyone who obtained access directly or indirectly through Customer or its Authorized Users, Customer will also take all steps reasonably necessary to terminate the unauthorized access or use and cooperate and assist with any actions taken by C.Scale to remediate any issues resulting from, or related to, such unauthorized access or use.

Customer will only permit the Services to be accessed by Customer‚Äôs employees and contractors that are authorized by Customer to access the applicable Services solely for Customer‚Äôs internal business purposes (‚Äú**Authorized** **Users**‚Äù), provided that Customer shall remain liable for all acts and omissions of such users.  Customer is solely responsible for determining the level of access and privileges granted to its Authorized Users.  Customer will ensure its Authorized Users‚Äô use of the Services is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and Customer will be solely responsible for enforcing any of Customer‚Äôs internal policies regarding its Authorized Users‚Äô use of the Services.

Due to the nature of AI technology, reports that the Services generate through use of AI (‚ÄúReports‚Äù) may be unpredictable, and may include inaccurate or incomplete responses. Before using any Reports, Customer is solely responsible for reviewing the Reports for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with applicable laws and acceptable use policies. Customer assumes all responsibility for the Reports.  All Reports will be deemed to be ‚ÄúCustomer Content‚Äù that is owned by Customer; _provided, however_, that nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to restrict C.Scale or the Services from providing the same or similar Reports to any other customer or user.  Customer is and will remain fully responsible and liable for the use and deployment of the Services for Customer‚Äôs use case and Customer acknowledges that C.Scale does not control how Customer deploys or implements the Services.

As between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for determining if the Third Party Services are appropriate for use with the Services and for obtaining all necessary consents, permissions, approvals, or licenses to access and use the Third Party Services.  Without limiting the foregoing, if Customer or an Authorized User provides C.Scale with access to any third party application programming interfaces (‚Äú**APIs**‚Äù), API keys or other credentials for the purpose of connecting or integrating the Services with the Third Party Services, then Customer represents and warrants that it has obtained all necessary consents, permissions, approvals, and/or licenses to access and use, and permit C.Scale to access and use, the same for the purpose of performing its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.

## 2. Fees, Payment

**2.1        Fees; Payment Terms**.  Customer agrees to pay to C.Scale the fees for each of the Services that Customer purchases or uses in accordance with the pricing and payment terms set forth in the Order, as may be updated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Unless otherwise expressly set forth in an Order, all recurring fees for Services subscriptions will be billed to Customer in advance.  Unless otherwise expressly set forth in an Order, Customer‚Äôs Services subscription will continue and automatically renew on a recurring basis at regular intervals in accordance with Customer‚Äôs elections at the time of sign up or in the applicable Order, unless and until Customer terminates Customer‚Äôs subscription in accordance with Section 3, or Customer‚Äôs Account is otherwise suspended or terminated pursuant to this Agreement.  The applicable subscription fees for any Renewal Subscription Terms (defined below) will be charged at C.Scale‚Äôs then-current list price, until the subscription or this Agreement terminates in accordance with this Agreement.  C.Scale reserves the right to change the terms, including pricing, for subscriptions to the Services from time to time in accordance with Section 7.4.  If Customer does not agree with such changes, Customer may terminate Customer‚Äôs subscription to the Services as set forth in Section 7.4.  C.Scale will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer of these changes, including by sending a notice to an email address associated with Customer‚Äôs Account.  C.Scale will not be able to notify Customer of any changes in applicable taxes in advance.

**2.2        Payment Method**.  Customer will be billed for all amounts due under this Agreement using the payment method provided by Customer to C.Scale‚Äôs third party payment processor at the time of sign-up; provided however, that Customer may update its payment method by contacting C.Scale Support at hi@cscale.io.  Customer‚Äôs acknowledges that C.Scale‚Äôs current payment process is Stripe, Inc. and Customer agrees to be bound by Stripe‚Äôs Privacy Policy (currently accessible at https://stripe.com/us/privacy) and its Terms of Service (currently accessible at https://stripe.com/ssa) and hereby consents and authorizes C.Scale and Stripe to share any information and payment instructions provided with one or more payment providers to the minimum extent required to complete the transactions. Customer must provide current, complete, and accurate information for Customer‚Äôs billing Account and promptly update all information to keep Customer‚Äôs billing Account current, complete, and accurate.  Fees paid by Customer are non-refundable, except as provided in this Agreement or when required by law.  In the event of a failed attempt to charge to Customer‚Äôs credit card (e.g., if Customer‚Äôs credit card has expired), C.Scale reserves the right to retry billing Customer‚Äôs credit card.  In the event that Customer or C.Scale (through our payment service providers) update Customer‚Äôs credit card information to remedy a change in validity or expiration date, C.Scale may automatically resume billing Customer for its paid subscription to the Services.  C.Scale may suspend or cancel Customer‚Äôs access to the Services if C.Scale remain unable to successfully charge the credit card information associated with Customer‚Äôs Account.  Additionally, C.Scale may charge Customer interest on overdue fees at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on the amount overdue.

**2.3        Automatic Renewal**.  Customer must terminate any automatically renewing subscription to the applicable Services at least five (5) days before it renews in accordance with this Agreement in order to avoid billing of the recurring subscription fees to Customer.  By choosing an automatically renewing subscription plan, Customer acknowledges that it has a recurring payment feature and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to termination.  If there are no valid payment methods on file for Customer, C.Scale may send Customer invoices for any amounts due, and Customer will pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of Customer‚Äôs receipt thereof.

**2.4        Taxes**.  Prices do not include, and Customer must pay or reimburse C.Scale for, all federal, state, local, sales, use, value added, excise, or other taxes, fees, or duties arising out of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than taxes based on C.Scale‚Äôs net income).  If C.Scale has a legal obligation to pay or collect sales tax for which Customer is responsible, C.Scale will calculate the sales tax based upon the billing information it has about Customer and charge Customer that amount (which, if Customer‚Äôs billing information is incomplete or inaccurate, may be the highest prevailing rate then in effect), unless Customer timely provides C.Scale with a valid tax exemption certificate acceptable to the appropriate taxing authority.

## 7. General Provisions

**7.1        Assignment**.  Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party may assign this Agreement, or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party, except that C.Scale may assign this Agreement without the written consent of Customer as part of the conversion to a corporation or other corporate reorganization, upon a change of control, consolidation, merger, reincorporation, sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement or a similar transaction or series of transactions.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

**7.2        Force Majeure**.  Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including without limitation an act of war, terrorism, act of God, earthquake, flood, embargo, riot, sabotage, labor shortage or dispute, governmental act or failure of the Internet.  The delayed party shall give the other party notice of such cause and shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to correct such failure or delay in performance.

**7.3        Governing** **Law; Jurisdiction and Venue**.  This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction.  Customer hereby expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts for San Francisco, California for any lawsuit filed there against Customer by C.Scale arising from or related to this Agreement.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.

**7.4        Modifications** **to** **this** **Agreement**.  C.Scale may modify this Agreement from time to time by giving notice to Customer through C.Scale‚Äôs online user interfaces, by sending Customer an email to an e-mail address associated with Customer‚Äôs Account, by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Services, or in any other manner permitted by this Agreement.  In the event that the last e-mail address that Customer has provided is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to Customer the notice described above, C.Scale‚Äôs dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes to this Agreement described in the notice.  Unless a shorter period is specified by C.Scale (e.g., due to changes in the law or exigent circumstances), the modifications become effective upon renewal of Customer‚Äôs current Subscription Term or entry into a new Order.  If C.Scale specifies that the modifications to this Agreement will take effect prior to Customer‚Äôs next renewal or Order and Customer notifies C.Scale in writing at [hi@cscale.io](mailto:hi@cscale.io) of Customer‚Äôs objection to the modifications within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, C.Scale (at its option and as Customer‚Äôs exclusive remedy) will either: (i) permit Customer to continue under the existing version of the Agreement until expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (after which time the modified Agreement will go into effect), or (ii) allow Customer to terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rata refund of any pre-paid Services subscription fees allocable to the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.  Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement in order to continue using the Services, and, in any event, continued use of the Services after the modified version of this Agreement becomes effective will constitute Customer‚Äôs acceptance of such modified version.

**7.5        Export** **Controls**; **Government** **Rights**.  Customer agrees that Customer will not, and will ensure that its Authorized Users will not, directly or indirectly, export or re-export, or knowingly permit the export or re-export of, the C.Scale Technology or any technical information about the C.Scale Technology to any country for which such export or re-export is restricted by any applicable U.S. regulation or statute, without the prior written consent, if required, of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, or such other government entity as may have jurisdiction over such export or re-export.  Customer hereby represents and warrants that: (i) Customer is not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a ‚Äúterrorist supporting‚Äù country, and (ii) Customer is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.  The C.Scale Technology is deemed to be ‚Äúcommercial computer software‚Äù and ‚Äúcommercial computer software documentation,‚Äù respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable.  Any use, modification, reproduction release, performance, display or disclosure of the software and accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government shall be governed solely by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

**7.6        Miscellaneous**.  This Agreement (together with the Orders) is the sole agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and it supersedes all prior agreements and understandings with respect to said subject matter.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of an Order and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will apply unless the Order expressly indicates that a provision of the Order should supersede contrary language in the Agreement.  No terms of any purchase order, acknowledgement or other form provided by Customer will modify this Agreement, regardless of any failure of C.Scale to object to such terms.  Any ambiguity in this Agreement shall be interpreted equitably without regard to which party drafted hereof.  Except as set forth in Section 7.4, this Agreement may only be amended by a writing signed by both parties.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts.  The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience and are not intended to affect the interpretation of this Agreement.  Any required notice shall be given in writing by customary means with receipt confirmed.  Notices to Customer shall be sent to the address set forth on the Order.  Notices to C.Scale shall be given to [hi@cscale.io](mailto:hi@cscale.io).  Notices will be deemed to have been given at the time of actual delivery in person, one (1) day after delivery to an overnight courtier service, or three (3) days after deposit in the mail.  The relationship between the parties shall be that of independent contractors.  C.Scale may use subcontractors.  Waiver of any term of this Agreement or forbearance to enforce any term by either party shall not constitute a waiver as to any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or a waiver of any other term of this Agreement.  Any provision found to be unlawful, unenforceable or void shall be severed from the remainder of this Agreement, and the Agreement will continue in full force and effect without said provision.&#x20;
