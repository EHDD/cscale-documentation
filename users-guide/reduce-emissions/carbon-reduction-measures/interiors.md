### Floor Area w/ Fit-Out

The percentage of floor space that will be fitted out for occupation by building tenants. The default value is 70%. If tenant fit-out is outside the project scope, this field can be set to 0%.

### Interior Fit Out Specification

The specification of the fittings, furniture, and fixtures required for the use of the building by its tenants. These specification levels do not describe specific fit-outs or materials. Instead, they approximate the 80th, 50th, and 20th percentile of the distribution of all available data on tenant fit-outs.&#x20;

#### Interiors Service Life
