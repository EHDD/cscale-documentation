# Sitework

When a user enters a site area, they have the option to select whether or not the site has been previously developed. If the site has been previously developed, C.Scale treats it as a "brownfield" site with no carbon sequestered in its soil and existing landscape. If the site has not been previously developed, C.Scale treats it as a "greenfield" site with preexisting vegetation.

### Planted Area

Set the percentage of site area, minus the building footprint, which is planted. To calculate emissions from the removal of above-ground biomass, C.Scale treats the site as vegetated with regionally-specific "low carbon storage" plants (such as no-mow turfgrass or other herbaceous perennials) at 50% of the site's carrying capacity. All unplanted area is assumed to be hardscape.&#x20;

#### High Carbon Storage Planted Area

Set the percentage of the planted site area comprised of a high carbon storage landscape, such as dense broadleaf shrubs and trees in a matrix of no-mow turfgrass or herbaceous perennials.

### Hardscape specification

All site area not designated as planted is assumed to be hardscaped. The specification of the pervious and impervious surfaces on the building site (outside the building enclosure. These specification levels do not describe specific materials or assemblies. Instead, they approximate the 80th, 50th, and 20th percentile of the distribution of all hardscape assemblies based on a set of standard details.&#x20;

<summary>Hardscape Specification Choices (Carbon Intensity)</summary>

* **Low Carbon (20th percentile).** 20th percentile of GWP for hardscape assemblies.&#x20;

- **Average (50th percentile).** 50th percentile of GWP for hardscape assemblies.&#x20;

* **High Carbon (80th percentile).** 80th percentile of GWP for hardscape assemblies.&#x20;

- **Custom**. Enter a custom carbon intensity.

#### Hardscape Service Life

The length of time over which a majority of the site's hardscape will be replaced.
