# Construction

### A5.2 Construction Activities

Enter a custom carbon intensity (kgCO₂e/sf) for emissions related to construction activities and land use. The default value assumes 40 kgCO₂e/m² for construction emissions, which includes fuel, tools, and energy used on-site. This default is adjustable based on project-specific data. For greenfield sites, emissions from soil and vegetation are also calculated, using regional data to estimate carbon release from land development.

### A5.1 Demolished Area

Pre-construction demolition emissions are calculated per floor area of the demolished building, using a default factor of 35 kgCO2e/m2. This is a data-scarce category. Where project-specific data is available, this default can be overridden by the user.
