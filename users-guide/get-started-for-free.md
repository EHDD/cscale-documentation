### Basic Workflow

In C.Scale, the basic workflow is:

1. [Create a Project](create-a-project/)&#x20;
2. [Set a Baseline](set-a-baseline.md)
3. [Reduce Emissions](reduce-emissions/)
4. [Compare Scenarios](compare-scenarios/)
5. [Create a Portfolio](create-a-portfolio/) \[Organization feature]
6. [Compare Projects within Portfolio](../compare-projects-within-portfolio.md) \[Organization feature]



### Important definitions

* A **Project** includes a baseline and one or more decarbonization scenarios.
* A **Baseline** is a scenario for a project where no attempts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. To define a baseline, C.Scale makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions based on user inputs. When C.Scale's "business as usual" assumptions are not appropriate, they can be refined.
* A **Scenario** is a set of strategies to lower a project's carbon emissions. Scenarios are constructed individually and compared against one another in the [Compare Scenarios](compare-scenarios/) tab.
* A **Portfolio** includes all active projects in your organization, allowing for an "apples to apples" comparison across the same scope categories and LCA stages.

### The C.Scale data model

The C.Scale app is powered by the [C.Scale data model.](broken-reference)
