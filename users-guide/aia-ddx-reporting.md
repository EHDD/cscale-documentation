# âš¡ AIA DDx Reporting

To create AIA DDx reports, make sure to set the [Target Scenario](compare-scenarios/set-target-scenario.md) for all the projects you want to include in the report.&#x20;



AIA DDx Reporting can be done in two ways within the C.Scale app:

1. <mark style="color:green;">**`Individual project reporting:`**</mark>

Inside the project, right above the Project Nam&#x65;**,** you'll find an Export button. Click on it and select the **AIA 2030 Commitment Embodied Carbon Report (PDF)**.

A pop-up menu opens up where you can choose the **Phase of Project** and **Export**.

The PDF report is designed to mirror the AIA DDx Reporting interface, making it easy for you to report. Just copy the content from the boxes and paste it directly into the Reporting interface! Easy, peasy!

2. <mark style="color:green;">**`Bulk reporting:`**</mark>

To bulk report multiple projects, go to the Organization Dashboard and click on the **Export button** located at the top-right of the projects table. From the drop-down, choose **AIA 2030 DDx Bulk Export.**

A pop-up menu will appear, displaying all the projects your organization is working on. You can either select All Projects or choose individual projects one by one that you want to report on. Once you've made your selection, click the Export button to proceed.

The exported Excel file contains all the essential information you need for reporting to the AIA 2030 Commitment. Below is an example of what the file may look like.
