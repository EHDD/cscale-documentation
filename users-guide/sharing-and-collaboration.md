# ⚡ Sharing and Collaboration

Sharing and collaboration is available in the shared Organization Account. To collaborate on projects in your personal account, you must first move them to the shared organization account. To do so, click on the **3-dot menu** to the right of the project name. Choose the **Move** option.

To switch to the **Organization Account**, click on the drop-down menu in the top-left corner of your screen where it currently says "**Personal Account**." From there, select the organization name (in this case, C.Scale).

Click on any project to see who in your organization has worked on it and made updates. In the left-hand panel, you’ll find a history showing when the project was last edited and by whom.
